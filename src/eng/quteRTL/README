========================= INTRODUCTION =========================

QuteRTL is a word-level framework developed for years. It generally supports 
synthesizable Verilog inputs and BLIF format designs, followed by a quick 
synthesizer which enables synthesizing CDFG (Control Data Flow Graph) into a 
word-level netlist, including logics, arithmetics, shifters, comparators, 
FFs ..., etc. Afterwards, it supports us to flatten a hierarchical design into 
a single flattened module. Output format can be either structural Verilog 
(hierarchical or flattened) or BLIF. Other than the main synthesis flow on RTL 
designs, QuteRTL front-end also provides several helpful utilities for users 
to understand their designs. In addition, QuteRTL implements several SAT-based 
model checking algorithms, including bounded model checking and induction.

In this version of release, we provide our source code for RTL front-end 
parser, synthesizer, circuit flatten, design output writer, and verification 
applications. Please refer to our website for detailed information.
